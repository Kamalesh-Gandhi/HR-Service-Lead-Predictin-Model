# **Predict High-Potential HR Service Leads**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict **high-potential HR service leads** based on companies' **funding and hiring trends**. The dataset includes **synthetic data** to simulate real-world scenarios for developing and testing predictive models. The goal is to classify companies as **"hot leads"** using machine learning techniques.

### ðŸ“‚ **`dataset/`**
This folder contains:
- **`train.csv`** â†’ Original training dataset  
- **`test.csv`** â†’ Original test dataset  
- **`holdout.csv`** â†’ Dataset for final prediction  
- **`cleaned_train.csv`** â†’ Preprocessed training data after cleaning, encoding, and scaling  

Each dataset has undergone **proper preprocessing steps**, ensuring **data consistency** across training, validation, and testing.
